# [Announcement: RSS 2025 Workshop<br><span class="h3">Wednesday, June 25, 2025</span>](/neurips-2024/)

## Abstract 
Our proposed workshop will explore the latest advances, challenges, and opportunities in human-robot collaboration where control is shared between human operators and autonomous systems. The workshop will focus on three themes: (1) adaptive manipulation, (2) intelligent mobility, and (3) human-centric interfaces, encompassing both foundational research and cutting-edge applications. By examining emerging technologies, user interface strategies, evaluation metrics, and ethical considerations, the workshop aims to foster a deeper understanding of how best to combine human insight and machine capabilities for real-world impact. We welcome a diverse range of participants, including academic researchers, industry practitioners, graduate students, and policymakers with an interest in shared autonomy.
